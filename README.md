# Coloring-greyscale-images-master
Coloring Greyscale Images is a project that utilizes deep learning models to automatically colorize black and white images. 
The full version adds information from a pre-trained classifier. You can think of the information as 20% nature, 30% humans, 30% sky, and 20% brick buildings. 
It then learns to combine that information with the black and white photo.
